##example
`this is a rule for email`

fsm or Final State Machine validator is a lexer that uses final state machines to make rules instead of regular expressions.
The idea is that final state machines are a better fit for validating strings and more customizable.

For an explanation about finite state machines there is a very good video about it on [numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjOCRYdg8BY).

## How to use
first you need to make a rule this is where the State class comes in
